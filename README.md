update: after years of refusing to do so, their dev team apparently figured out how to run some basic commands to wrap a [official client](https://asana.com/download). Good job, your team managed accomplish what a incompetent student did in a day. Well done. If you read this, don't get Asana. IMHO it's shit.

# Asana Desktop
Nothing fancy, just a simple nativefier build and some instructions how to do it from scratch.

Download it for [MacOS](https://github.com/cyanit/asana-desktop/releases/download/1.0/asana-osx-v1.dmg) or [Windows](https://github.com/cyanit/asana-desktop/releases/download/1.0/asana-win-v1.zip).

There are **[Manual Build Instructions](https://github.com/cyanit/asana-desktop/blob/main/build%20instructions.md)** with an easy walktrough availible, in case you are new to node, npm and/or nativefier. They are basically the code and documentation in case you want to know whats actually in the binaries.
